   *Reason: The text discusses Bitcoin's strong performance and positive long-term factors for September 2025, but it focuses on structural, multi-cycle trends rather than short-term price movements. It explicitly avoids short-term technical analysis and highlights both positive drivers and lingering risks, making it inconclusive for the next 4 hours.*
